**Project Title:** Student Affairs Management System

**Project Description:**

The Student Affairs Management System is a comprehensive software project developed using Java and Spring Boot, designed to efficiently manage student records within an educational institution. This system provides a user-friendly interface for adding, modifying, deleting, and displaying student information. It streamlines the administrative processes related to student affairs, making it easier for educational institutions to maintain accurate and up-to-date student data.

2. **Student Information Modification:** Authorized personnel can easily update student information, including contact details, program of study, and academic records. This feature ensures that the database remains current and accurate.

3. **Student Deletion:** When a student graduates, transfers, or leaves the institution, administrators can securely delete their records from the system to maintain data privacy and compliance with regulations.

4. **Student Search and Display:** The system provides a powerful search functionality that allows users to quickly retrieve student information based on various criteria, such as name, ID, or program. The displayed information includes personal details, academic history, and contact information.

5. **Role-Based Access Control:** The Student Affairs Management System implements role-based access control to ensure that only authorized staff members can perform actions like adding, modifying, or deleting student records. This helps maintain data integrity and security.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Framework:** Spring Boot
